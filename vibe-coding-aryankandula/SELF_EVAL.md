# Self Evaluation (Rubric)

## Part 1: Functionality (30 pts)
- Working Application (15/15): The single-file `numberguess-final.html` runs locally, accepts guesses, validates input, gives higher/lower hints, counts attempts, and includes a reset. **15/15**
- Usability (10/10): Clear instructions, attempt counters, accessible message area, and keyboard support. **10/10**
- Iteration Evidence (5/5): PROMPTS.md documents 5 prompts and iterations. **5/5**

**Part 1 total: 30/30**

## Part 2: AI Collaboration (30 pts)
- Prompt Documentation (10/10): PROMPTS.md contains 5 prompts with results and lessons. **10/10**
- Iteration Process (10/10): Multiple iterations shown (build, validation, extra features, accessibility, polish). **10/10**
- Critical Engagement (10/10): I tested, found bugs, and asked AI to fix them rather than accepting output blindly. **10/10**

**Part 2 total: 30/30**

## Part 3: Framework Exploration (20 pts)
- SPA Investigation (10/10): I asked about SPAs and documented that React was recommended and why. (See REFLECTION.md). **10/10**
- Comparison & Insight (10/10): Reflection states tradeoffs and when a framework is/ is not appropriate. **10/10**

**Part 3 total: 20/20**

## Part 4: Reflection Quality (20 pts)
- Honest Assessment (10/10): Candid about when AI helped and where it failed. **10/10**
- Learning Demonstrated (5/5): Shows clear takeaways about AI & web dev. **5/5**
- Curiosity & Questions (5/5): Thoughtful next questions (how frameworks manage state). **5/5**

**Part 4 total: 20/20**

**TOTAL: 100/100**

Notes: If you change any deliverables (omit accessibility or iterations), deduct points accordingly. This evaluation assumes you include the three files and the working HTML.
