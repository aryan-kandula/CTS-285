# Reflection

## 1. The AI as Collaborator
The AI helped most by producing a complete working HTML prototype in seconds, which saved setup time. It frustrated me when small input validation or UX details were missing and required additional prompts and testing. I was surprised how quickly I could iterate — but also that I needed to understand the logic to fix bugs.

## 2. The Framework Experiment
When asked about SPAs, the AI recommended React as a common choice, but noted it requires a build step and more files. For this simple game, raw HTML+JS was faster and less error-prone. If I were building a larger app with stateful UI and many components, I would choose React or Svelte, but not for a one-file student assignment.

## 3. The “Vibe Coding Ceiling”
I hit a point when the AI gave code I could not immediately debug mentally — I then had to read and test step-by-step to find the issue. The ceiling occurred when persistence or advanced state management was needed (e.g., saving best score across reloads). Next time I will ask the AI for smaller testable snippets before asking for a whole file.

## 4. Growth Moment
I learned that AI speeds prototyping but responsibility for correctness remains with me. I improved basic web development skills: wiring inputs, handling events, and simple validation. My next question is: how do frameworks like React actually handle state updates differently from direct DOM manipulation?
